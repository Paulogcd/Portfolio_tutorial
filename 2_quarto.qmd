Now that we know how to use Git and Github together, it is time for us to use Quarto. 

## Installation of Quarto

The first step of this chapter is to download Quarto [here](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/).

![Installation page of Quarto](./resources/images/2_1_install_quarto.png)


## Create a Quarto project

The second step is to create a quarto project in your folder (the one you synchronized with your online GitHub repository). In order to do that, you can go in vscode, and enter in the terminal `quarto create`. You will then be guided with several questions regarding the nature of the project you wish to create. For the purpose of creating a portfolio, I would recommend to choose to create a website. 

![Creation of a project with Quarto](./resources/images/2_2_create_project_quarto.png)

After entering `quarto create`, quarto asks you different things : 

1. The nature of the quarto environment you want to create. You have the choice between a `project` and an `extension`. For a portfolio, I recommend creating a project. 
2. The type of your project. It gives you the choice between : 
    - default
    - website
    - blog
    - manuscript
    - book
    - confluence

    You could choose another different kinds of projects here. For example, `default` would work well enough also. However, I recommend creating `website` for the sake of simplicity.
3. Quarto then asks for the Directory you wish to create your quarto project in. Since you are already in the folder you opened with vscode, you should write a simple dot `.` and press enter.  

> Note : The dot `.` refers to the current directory in several langages. To understand better how a path works, I recommend consulting [this article](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_filepaths.asp).

Once the creation process is done, you will see appear in your folder several files : index.qmd, about.qmd, _quarto.yml, style.css. 

Let's take a moment to see what they do : 

1. The files with a ".css" extension are Cascading Style Sheets (css) files. Together with HTML, they are one of the main langages for web development. They are mainly responsisble for the appearance and design of websites. It is not necessary to modify them for the purpose of this tutorial, but you can inform yourself about it [on this tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/css/).
2. The files with a ".qmd" extension are quarto files. This extension stands for Quarto MarkDown. They correspond to what the future pages of your website will be. They support various langages, like traditional Markdown or $\LaTeX$. We will change our portfolio pages by modifying these pages. 
3. The files with a ".yml" extension are configuration files. We use them to set some rules that quarto will apply to generate our pages. For example, we will modify the navigation bar (or navbar) through our these files later in this chapter.

## The preview and render commands

Quarto allows us to create a properly designed website by only interacting with basic qmd files. We need however to see what results they yield. 

To see the graphical result of our qmd files, we need to use two main commands : the `quarto preview` and `quarto render` commands.

The `quarto preview` command allows to see in real time what the changes we are bringing to our qmd and yml files yield.
After entering it in the terminal console, it automatically opens a page on your default browser where you can see the graphical results of the latest saved version of your qmd and yml files.
If there is an error with your files (for example a bad configuration within your yaml file), you won't be able to see correctly the results, and an error message
will pop-up. We usually use it at the beginning of a work session, when we bring change to our portfolio. 

The `quarto render` command allows to create html and css files from our qmd and yml files. We usually use it at the end of a work session, when we are satisfied with the changes we brought to the our website.
Essentially, it does the same as the `preview` command, without opening a browser to see your changes in real time. 

Let's try to run the `quarto preview` command : 

![Running the quarto preview command on the vscode terminal.](./resources/images/2_3_quarto_preview_1.png)

You should briefly see some blue text "preparing to preview", followed by the names of your qmd files, before your default browser automatically launches itself. 

If you did not modify the basic files, you should see something like this on your web browser : 

![The graphical result of an empty quarto project.](./resources/images/2_4_quarto_preview_2.png)

Okay, we have our first graphical results ! What happened exactly here ? 
First, you entered `quarto preview`. Quarto first transformed all your qmd files in your folder in readable files for you web browser, i.e. html and css files.
Then, it opened those html and css files with your default browser. What you are seeing is the result of this conversion from qmd to html and css.

> Note : You can notice that the URL of your page looks a bit different from normal websites you access. Indeed, you should have something like "http://localhost:6986/", or any other kind of four numbers combination. 
This is because quarto is currently watching at your file, and will refresh the page as soon as any of your qmd or yaml files are changed and saved. 
Without entering into the details, "localhost" means that it is your computer, and the four numbers are the port of your computer quarto is using to display the files.

> Note : Now, your terminal is busy reading your files in the web browser. You can create a new terminal session by clicking on the "+" in vscode. 
To stop the process, you can click on your terminal and then enter `ctrl`+`c` (`command`+`c` for MacOS keyboards).

## How to modify our content

Now that we rendered the first version of our page, how do we modify its content ? 

If we want to modify the homepage of our website, we can go to the `index.qmd` file, and change directly the text. 
By default, Quarto should have filled the document with : 

```{.yml}
---
title: "Home"
---

This is a Quarto website.

To learn more about Quarto websites visit <https://quarto.org/docs/websites>.

```
That yields the previous image.


We can modify it by writting for example : 
```{.qmd}
---
title: "Home"
---

Hello, I am Paulo Gugelmo, currently a first year
student of the Master of Research in Economics at Sciences Po. 
My research interests are environmental economics. 

Feel free to reach out to me at my email adress :
"paulo.gugelmocavalheirodias" followed by "@sciencespo.fr" !

```

This should yield : 

![Basic index page.](./resources/images/2_5_basic_index.png)

> Note : you should usually avoid putting your entire email adress directly in your webpage.
Some bots are constantly scrapping webpages to get potential email adress that are later on the target of spam or fraudulous emails.


As you see, the changes are pretty straightforward. Since qmd files are basically a form of markdown file, you can use the markdown syntax for your content. 
If you are not familiar with it, it is easy to understand. I encourage you to go check [some documentation](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/). 

For plain text, note that you can enter jumplines without actually rendering a jumpline. 
If you want to do a breakline, you should let at least one empty line between two text chunks. 

We are now going to cover some features of markdown.

### Titles and subtitles

If you write plain text in your qmd file, you will get normal text in your page. However, if you want to have titles and subtitles, you can use the `#` sign before it.

In this way, one `#` will yiel a title, two `#` a subtitle, etc., until the sixth level. With text filler, we could write the following code : 

```{.yml}
---
title: "Home"
---

# Title 

Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit,
sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.
Ut enim ad minim veniam, quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris 
nisi ut aliquip ex ea commodo consequat.

## A Subtitle 

Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit,
sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.
Ut enim ad minim veniam, quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris 
nisi ut aliquip ex ea commodo consequat.

### A subsubtitle 

Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit,
sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.
Ut enim ad minim veniam, quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris 
nisi ut aliquip ex ea commodo consequat.

```

This would then yield : 

![Example of titles and subtitles.](./resources/images/2_6_titles.png)

It is as simple as that, and by default, Quarto creates a table of content automatically for us in the right-side of our page !

### Adding links

Now, if we want to add some link to our text, we are going to use the `[text](link)` markdown syntax.
Concretely, the text will be between square brackets `[]`, and the link we want between parenthesis `()`.

For example this code : 

```{.yml}

---
title: "Home"
---

Feel free to reach out to me at my email adress :
"paulo.gugelmocavalheirodias" followed by "@sciencespo.fr" !

```

will yield : 

![Example of links usage.](./resources/images/2_7_links.png)

And if you click on the links in your browser, you should be redirected to the url you wrote ! 

### Adding documents and pictures

Now, we could also want to include some pictures in our text.
For example, some pdf of a long article we wrote or screeenshots. 

In order to do so, we are going to use the `![description](link)` markdown syntax.

In the previous example, we had url as links, that could be accessed on internet. 
Now, let's imagine that you have a pdf file in your computer that you want to share on your portfolio. 
Usually, such a pdf is not available online on a public url. 

THe first step we want to do is put the files you want to share in your folder in vscode. You should have something like that : 

![A vscode folder with files that you want to share.](./resources/images/2_8_vscode_files.png)

Note that in the left side of my screen, in the explorer bar, I now have to additional files : "screenshot.png" and "2_8_markdown_guide.pdf". 

If we want to include them, we could write : 

```{.yml}

Here is an interesting website :

![A screenshot of the CRAN website.](screenshot.png)

Here is an interesting guide : 

![This is the Markdown guide, written by Matt Cone.](2_8_markdown_guide.pdf)

Feel free to reach out to me at my email adress :
"paulo.gugelmocavalheirodias" followed by "@sciencespo.fr" !

```

This code would yield : 

![An attempt to include pictures and pdf](./resources/images/2_9_including_documents.png)

We see that the picture, a screenshot of the CRAN website, seems to work fine. 
However, the markdown guide, written by Matt Cone, and [available here](https://markdown.p2hp.com/assets/book/markdown-guide.pdf), is displayed in a smaller dimension than the page. 
This is due to the fact that we are trying to include a pdf as a picture. 
To include a pdf, we can thus use the normal link syntax, while directing to the emplacement of our pdf file.
In this way, a syntax similar to `You can read the markdown guide of Matt Conen [by clicking on this link](2_8_markdown_guide.pdf)` would work better. 
We could thus write : 

```{.yml}

title: "Home"

That would yield : 

![Including a pdf document through a local link.](./resources/images/2_10_including_documents_2.png)

And if we click on the link, we are redirected to the pdf file within our browser. 

For the case of a portfolio, we could for example include our CV in this fashion. 

### Adding code 

Now, we might want to include code snippets in our portfolio. 
For example, we have a project for which we wrote in R or any other languages, and we want to make the code easily accessible by our visitors. 

In order for us to do that, we have two options. Either we want to include code inline, in which way we write our code between thos reversed ticks : ``, or we want to include a code snippet, 
in which case we use the following syntax : 
```{.yml}
```{r}
# print("Hello world !")
```
````

This is not working. 

### Adding math

- links
- pages
- pictures
- other documents

## How to modify the navigation bar

An essential element of the website is the navigation bar. In Quarto, it is automatically displayed in all your pages, and you can only modify it in your `_quarto.yml` file. Let's take a look at it : 

```{.yml}
project:
  type: website

website:
  title: "portfolio"
  navbar:
    left:
      - href: index.qmd
        text: Home
      - about.qmd

format:
  html:
    theme: cosmo
    css: styles.css
    toc: true
```

In this example, the content of the navigation bar, or "navbar", are determined by all elements following the `navbar` element in the `website` list.
Here, we see that it has two elements : the homepage, defined as the index.qmd file, and the about page, defined as the `about.qmd` file.

Normally, the title of you page should appear in your browser, despite not being specified in your navbar. This is the default setting of Quarto.
To unable this option, you can add `title: false` in your `navbar` list : 

```{.yml}
website:
  title: "portfolio"
  navbar:
    title: false
    left:
      - href: index.qmd
        text: Home
      - about.qmd
```

This should yield : 

![Add image](./resources/images/0_Default_image.png)

To add a new page to your navbar, you can add an element in the `left` or `right` list such as : 

```{.yml}
website:
  title: "portfolio"
  navbar:
    title: false
    left:
      - href: index.qmd
        text: Home
      - project.qmd
      - about.qmd
```

For this to work, you must have created a `project.qmd` file beforehand in your folder. This will then implement a new link in the navbar, displayed in its left part, having for name the name of file, i.e. here `project` : 

![Add image](./resources/images/0_Default_image.png)

## Further resources

Quarto is a very powerful tool. We can use it to quickly produce content and maintain it with the presented workflow in this tutorial.
I highly recommend the reading of their [documentation here](https://quarto.org/docs/guide/), and more specifically to follow through their [Get Started guide](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/).
